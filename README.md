# Machine Learning Projects
## TFX for Machine Learning Pipelines
In both of my projects, I used TFX (TensorFlow Extended) to create machine learning pipelines. TFX is a powerful open-source platform for building scalable and production-ready machine learning pipelines. It includes components for data ingestion, data validation, transformation, training, evaluation, and serving.

### ExampleGen for Data Ingestion
The first step in the pipeline is to ingest data from the source. I used the ExampleGen component of TFX to read data from my input CSV files and convert it into a standard TensorFlow format called TFRecord. ExampleGen also performed data validation and split the data into training and evaluation sets.

### StatisticsGen and SchemaGen for Data Analysis
The StatisticsGen component of TFX was used to generate descriptive statistics of the input data, such as mean, variance, and feature distributions. These statistics were used for data analysis and visualization in TensorBoard. The SchemaGen component of TFX was used to generate a schema for the input data, which describes the expected shape and type of each feature. The schema was used to validate the data and ensure consistency across the pipeline.

### Transform for Data Preprocessing
After ingesting data, the next step is to preprocess it to convert it into a format suitable for training. I used the Transform component of TFX to apply various transformations to my data, including normalization, feature engineering, and feature scaling. The transformed data was stored in another set of TFRecord files.

### Trainer for Model Training
The Trainer component of TFX was used to train my Keras-based neural network models using the preprocessed data. It uses the TensorFlow Estimator API to define and train models, and supports both distributed and non-distributed training.

### Evaluator for Model Evaluation
Once the model is trained, the Evaluator component is used to evaluate its performance on the evaluation dataset. It calculates various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Pusher for Model Serving
Finally, the Pusher component is used to serve the trained model. It exports the model in a format suitable for deployment and sends it to a target location, such as a cloud storage bucket or a Kubernetes cluster.

### TensorBoard for Model Visualization
During training and evaluation, I used TensorBoard to visualize various aspects of the model such as its architecture, loss, and metrics. TensorBoard provides a web-based interface for interactive visualization and exploration of the data and models.

Overall, TFX provides a powerful and flexible platform for building end-to-end machine learning pipelines. It simplifies the process of building scalable and production-ready machine learning models, while providing a rich set of tools for monitoring and debugging the pipeline.
